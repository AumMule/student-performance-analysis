# Student Performance Analysis (NumPy & Pandas)

## Project Overview
This project focuses on analyzing student performance data using **Pandas** and **NumPy**.  
The goal was to practice data manipulation, aggregation, and feature engineering while gaining hands-on experience with Python data analysis libraries.

The dataset contains student-wise subject records with marks, attendance, semester information, and derived grades.

---

## Tools & Libraries Used
- Python
- Pandas (data manipulation and analysis)
- NumPy (numerical computations and conditional logic)

---

## Analysis Performed Using Pandas
- Explored the dataset structure using functions like `shape`, `dtypes`, and `describe`
- Calculated average marks per subject using group-by operations
- Identified highest and lowest marks
- Filtered students based on performance conditions (e.g., marks below a threshold)
- Analyzed grade distribution using categorical counts

---

## Analysis Performed Using NumPy
- Converted Pandas columns into NumPy arrays for numerical computation
- Calculated mean, median, and standard deviation of marks
- Used NumPy conditional logic to assign grades based on predefined mark ranges
- Created new features (Grade column) to simplify performance analysis

---

## Key Insights
- Subject-wise averages highlighted differences in student performance across subjects
- Students with lower attendance or lower marks were easily identified as at-risk
- Grade distribution provided a clear overview of overall academic performance

## Reflection
This was my first hands-on project using NumPy and Pandas, and it was challenging initially due to limited prior practice.  
However, completing this project helped me understand core data analysis concepts and improved my confidence in working with Python-based data tools.  
I plan to explore more datasets and deepen my understanding of data analysis workflows.
